# ndk-pkg-prefab-example-libphonenumber

A simplest example to show you how to use the google prefab aar that created by [ndk-pkg](https://github.com/leleliu008/ndk-pkg)

# Note

Due to github's file size limitation, I don't put libphonenumber prefab aar file into https://github.com/leleliu008/ndk-pkg-prefab-aar-maven-repo , but I published it as GitHub Releases, you should go to https://github.com/leleliu008/ndk-pkg-prefab-aar-maven-repo/releases to download it then uncompress it to your Maven Local Repository.
